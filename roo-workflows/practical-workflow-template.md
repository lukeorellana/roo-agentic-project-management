## Mode Handover: [From Mode] â†’ [To Mode]
**Date**: [Current date]
**Project**: [Project name]

**Completed Work**:

- **What's Remaining**: [Outstanding items]
- **Any Blockers**: [Issues preventing progress]

**Context for Next Mode**:
- **Background**: [Essential context needed]
- **Key Decisions**: [Important choices made]
- **Resources**: [Files, docs, references needed]

**Next Actions**:
- [ ] Specific task 1
- [ ] Specific task 2
- [ ] Specific task 3

**Memory Bank Updates**: [Which files were updated]
```

## Phase 4: End-of-Day Review (Architect Mode)

### Daily Wrap-up Template
```markdown
## Daily Review Checklist
- [ ] All Memory Bank entries reviewed
- [ ] Implementation Plan progress updated
- [ ] Tomorrow's priorities identified
- [ ] Any process improvements documented
- [ ] Automated tasks scheduled (if using Roo CLI)

## Today's Accomplishments
- [x] [Accomplishment 1]
- [x] [Accomplishment 2]
- [x] [Accomplishment 3]

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. [ ] [Priority task 1]
2. [ ] [Priority task 2]
3. [ ] [Priority task 3]

## Notes and Improvements
- [Any lessons learned or process improvements]
```

## Integration with Roo CLI (Optional but Recommended)

### Setting Up Automation
```bash
# Create a project automation script
# File: rapm-automation.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "RAPM Daily Automation Starting..."

# Validate current state
roo-cli validate --implementation-plan ./Implementation_Plan.md
roo-cli memory-bank check ./Memory/

# Run any automated tasks
if [ "$1" = "morning" ]; then
    echo "Running morning setup..."
    roo-cli status report --format daily
elif [ "$1" = "evening" ]; then
    echo "Running evening cleanup..."
    roo-cli memory-bank validate
    roo-cli backup create
fi
```

### Automated Quality Checks
```bash
# Automated checks to run between mode transitions
roo-cli lint --auto-fix
roo-cli test --fast
roo-cli docs validate
```

## Weekly Workflow Pattern

### Monday: Planning and Architecture
- **Architect Mode**: Weekly planning, Implementation Plan updates
- **Roo CLI**: Set up automated weekly reports

### Tuesday-Thursday: Primary Development
- **Code Mode**: Major implementation work
- **Debug Mode**: Issue resolution
- **Roo CLI**: Continuous integration and testing

### Friday: Review and Documentation
- **Ask Mode**: Research and documentation
- **Architect Mode**: Weekly review and next week planning
- **Roo CLI**: Generate weekly reports and backups

## Common Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Starting a New Feature
```markdown
1. **Architect Mode**: Review Implementation Plan, identify feature requirements
2. **Ask Mode**: Research technical approaches and best practices
3. **Code Mode**: Implement core functionality
4. **Debug Mode**: Test and resolve issues
5. **Architect Mode**: Review completion and plan next steps
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Workflow
```markdown
1. **Debug Mode**: Investigate and reproduce issue
2. **Ask Mode**: Research solution approaches (if needed)
3. **Code Mode**: Implement fix
4. **Debug Mode**: Verify fix and test edge cases
5. **Architect Mode**: Update processes to prevent recurrence
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Integration
```markdown
1. **Architect Mode**: Plan integration strategy
2. **Orchestrator Mode**: Coordinate multiple components
3. **Code Mode**: Implement integration points
4. **Debug Mode**: Test integration scenarios
5. **Ask Mode**: Document integration patterns
6. **Architect Mode**: Review and plan deployment
```

## Productivity Tips

### Efficient Mode Switching
- **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group similar work to minimize mode switches
- **Prepare Context**: Have all needed information ready before switching
- **Use Templates**: Standardize handover processes with templates

### Memory Bank Best Practices
- **Log Early and Often**: Don't wait until end of day
- **Be Specific**: Include enough detail for future reference
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related entries and tasks

### Automation Opportunities
- **Repetitive Checks**: Use Roo CLI for routine validations
- **Status Reports**: Automate daily/weekly progress reports
- **Quality Gates**: Set up automated quality checks

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Losing Context Between Modes
**Solution**: Use detailed handover templates and Memory Bank entries

### Problem: Mode Coordination Overhead
**Solution**: Batch similar tasks and use lightweight handovers for simple transitions

### Problem: Inconsistent Documentation
**Solution**: Use standardized templates and regular Memory Bank reviews

### Problem: Automation Failures
**Solution**: Start with simple Roo CLI automations and gradually increase complexity

This template provides a practical, repeatable workflow that teams can adapt to their specific needs while maintaining the structured approach that makes RAPM effective.
