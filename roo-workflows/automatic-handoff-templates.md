## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Mode

1. **Always include the task completion summary**
2. **Clearly specify which mode to switch to**
3. **Provide complete context references**
4. **Give specific, actionable objectives**
5. **Include clear expected outputs**
6. **Specify logging requirements**

### Handoff Decision Logic

**Code Mode handoffs to:**
- ü™≤ Debug Mode: When implementation needs testing/verification
- üèóÔ∏è Architect Mode: When phase is complete and needs review/next phase planning
- ‚ùì Ask Mode: When implementation reveals need for research/documentation

**Debug Mode handoffs to:**
- üíª Code Mode: When bugs are identified and need fixes
- üèóÔ∏è Architect Mode: When debugging reveals systemic issues requiring plan updates
- ‚ùì Ask Mode: When issues require research/investigation

**Ask Mode handoffs to:**
- üíª Code Mode: When research provides implementation guidance
- üèóÔ∏è Architect Mode: When research suggests plan modifications
- ü™≤ Debug Mode: When research identifies testing strategies

**Architect Mode handoffs to:**
- üíª Code Mode: For implementation tasks
- ü™≤ Debug Mode: For testing/verification tasks
- ‚ùì Ask Mode: For research/documentation tasks
- ü™É Orchestrator Mode: For complex multi-step workflows

**Orchestrator Mode handoffs to:**
- Any mode based on the next focused work type needed

## Benefits of This System

1. **Zero Context Loss**: Completing mode knows exactly what context next mode needs
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: User just copies and switches modes
3. **Consistent Quality**: Standardized handoffs ensure nothing is missed
4. **Faster Workflow**: Eliminates manual prompt creation step
5. **Better Continuity**: Seamless progression through Implementation Plan
6. **Smart Dispatching**: Each mode becomes an intelligent task router

This automatic handoff system maintains all the quality benefits of RAPM's structured approach while dramatically reducing the manual overhead of coordinating between Roo modes.
