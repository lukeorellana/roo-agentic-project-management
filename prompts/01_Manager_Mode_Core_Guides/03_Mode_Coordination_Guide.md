# RAPM Mode Coordination Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides instructions for you, the Manager Mode (Architect), to effectively coordinate different Roo modes within the Roo Agentic Project Management (RAPM) framework. Mode coordination is the primary mechanism for delegating work, managing context transitions, and ensuring project coherence across different types of activities.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Mode Specialization:** Each Roo mode has specific strengths and should be used for tasks that align with those strengths.
* **Context Preservation:** Information must be preserved and properly transferred when switching between modes.
* **Clear Handovers:** Transitions between modes should be explicitly managed with proper documentation.
* **Efficient Coordination:** Minimize unnecessary mode switches while ensuring appropriate specialization.
* **Progress Tracking:** Maintain visibility into work across all modes through the Memory Bank system.

## 5. Mode Handover Protocols

### 5.1. Quick Context Switch (Same Session)

For simple transitions within the same work session:

```markdown
## Mode Transition Brief
**From:** [Current mode]
**To:** [Target mode]
**Task:** [Brief description]
**Context:** [Essential context for next mode]
**Files:** [Relevant files to review]
**Expected Outcome:** [What should be delivered]
```

### 5.2. Detailed Handover (Complex Tasks)

For complex transitions or significant context transfer:

```markdown
## Detailed Mode Handover
**Project:** [Project identifier]
**Handover Date:** [Date/timestamp]
**From Mode:** [Current mode and specific role]
**To Mode:** [Target mode and intended role]

**Current Status:**
- [What has been accomplished]
- [Current state of work]
- [Any blockers or issues]

**Context for Next Mode:**
- [Background information needed]
- [Key decisions made so far]
- [Important constraints or requirements]
- [Technical context or dependencies]

**Specific Assignment:**
