## 3. Advanced Coordination Patterns

### Automated Context Gathering

```markdown
## Roo Cline's Context Management

### Using File Operations for Task Context
```javascript
// Example: Architect mode gathering context for next task
// Uses read_file to understand current project state

1. Read Implementation_Plan.md to identify next task
2. Read relevant Memory Bank entries for context
3. Use search_files to find related code or documentation
4. Prepare comprehensive task assignment for appropriate mode
```

### Cross-Mode Data Flow
```markdown
## Information Flow Between Modes

### Code Mode ‚Üí Debug Mode
1. Code Mode logs implementation to Memory Bank
2. Includes specific test cases and expected behavior
3. Debug Mode reads context and executes testing
4. Results logged back to Memory Bank

### Ask Mode ‚Üí Code Mode
1. Ask Mode researches implementation approaches
2. Documents findings and recommendations in Memory Bank
3. Code Mode reads research and implements solution
4. Implementation references research decisions

### All Modes ‚Üí Architect Mode
1. Each mode logs progress and outcomes
2. Architect Mode reviews all Memory Bank entries
3. Updates Implementation Plan based on progress
4. Coordinates next steps and priorities
```

## 4. Workflow Automation Using Roo's Capabilities

### Automated Progress Tracking

```markdown
## Progress Tracking Workflow

### Daily Status Check (Architect Mode)
1. Use search_files to find recent Memory Bank entries
2. Use read_file to review completed tasks
3. Update Implementation Plan with progress
4. Use update_todo_list to track remaining work
5. Plan mode assignments for upcoming tasks

### Automated Context Preparation
1. Use list_files to understand project structure
2. Use search_files to find relevant previous work
3. Use read_file to gather specific context
4. Prepare comprehensive handover documents
```

### Template-Based Task Creation

```markdown
## Task Template System

### Standard Task Assignment Template
```markdown
# Task Assignment: [Task Name]

## Context from Previous Work
[Auto-gathered using Roo's file operations]

## Requirements
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]

## Expected Deliverables
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

## Memory Bank Logging
Log completion to: Memory/[Phase]/[Task]_Log.md
Include: Implementation details, decisions made, next steps

## Success Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
```

### Mode-Specific Templates
**Code Mode Task Template:**
- Implementation requirements
- File paths to modify/create
- Coding standards to follow
- Testing requirements

**Debug Mode Task Template:**
- Problem description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Test cases to verify fix

**Ask Mode Task Template:**
